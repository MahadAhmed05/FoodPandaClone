        <p>
          If you choose delivery, a foodpanda rider will collect your order from
          the restaurant and take it to your chosen delivery address. If you
          choose Pick-Up, you can takeaway your food directly from the
          restaurant for extra savings – and to jump to the front of the queue.
          Pick-Up orders are available for restaurants only.
